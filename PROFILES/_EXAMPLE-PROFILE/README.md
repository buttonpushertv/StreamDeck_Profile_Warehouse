To submit a set of profile files, you need to follow these steps:

1. Export the Stream Deck Profile you'd like to share with the world. Use the "Export" function from the Profiles window of the Stream Deck Control Panel.

2. Grab a simple screen shot of the same panel from within the Stream Deck Control Panel.

If you have nested folders, it would nice to make screen grabs of those as well.

3. Place everything in a folder & ZIP it.

4. To make a submission, click on 'Issues' above and create a new issue.
