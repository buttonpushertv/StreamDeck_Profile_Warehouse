# StreamDeck_Profile_Warehouse
As a member of the community of Colorists (and editors, motion graphic designers, etc) at [mixinglight.com](http:\\mixinglight.com), we were discussing ways to share layouts for our individual SteamDeck Profiles.

This repository has been setup as a place to submit your StreamDeck Profiles (& any other supporting files you'd like to share).

To make a submission, follow the instructions below and then submit an "Issue" using the link above.

### To Make a Submission
To submit a set of profile files, you need to follow these steps:

1. Export the Stream Deck Profile you'd like to share with the world. Use the "Export" function from the Profiles window of the Stream Deck Control Panel.

![Export a profile](PROFILES/_EXAMPLE-PROFILE/export_streamdeck_profile.png)

2. Grab a simple screen shot of the same panel from within the Stream Deck Control Panel.
![Screenshot a profile](PROFILES/_EXAMPLE-PROFILE/example_streamdeck_profile_grab.jpg)

If you have nested folders, it would nice to make screen grabs of those as well.

3. Place everything in a folder & ZIP it.

4. To make a submission, click on 'Issues' above and create a new issue.

Thanks,
Ben
