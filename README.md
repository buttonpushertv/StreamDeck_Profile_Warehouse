# StreamDeck_Profile_Warehouse
As a member of the community of Colorists (and editors, motion graphic designers, etc) at [mixinglight.com](http:\\mixinglight.com), we were discussing ways to share layouts for our individual SteamDeck Profiles.

This repository has been setup as a place to submit your StreamDeck Profiles (& any other supporting files you'd like to share).

To make a submission, just submit a "Pull Request" above and follow the instructions there.

Thanks,
Ben
